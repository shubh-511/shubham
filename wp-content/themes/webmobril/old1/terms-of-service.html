                <div class="text"><b>Offering fast, affordable, quality and reliable web hosting since, 2002</br>
				
				<p class="text-6">
                WebMobril Networks primary objective is to value and support our customers. Our management and staff will provide the highest level of attention and dedication to all of our customers.<br><br>
				
				WebMobril.com provides web hosting to a large number of clients. We have a responsibility to protect each client and provide the best services available. The following guidelines have been established to ensure this intent is met.<br><br>
				
				Use of services from Infrenion.com, hereafter referred to as "Infrenion.com" constitutes acceptance and agreement to these terms. From herewith in this Terms of Service ("TOS"), the usage of "us", "we", "our", "ours" shall constitute reference to Infrenion.com, the usage of "you', "your", "they", "them" shall refer to the client / customer of Infrenion.com. All clients, servers, traffic, and equipment of Infrenion.com are subject to terms herein.<br><br>
				
				<b>Contact & Billing Information:</b><br>
				You must provide us with, and keep current, accurate contact information for you. This includes but is not limited to E-mail addresses not based on the main domain of your account and telephone contacts. Maintaining accurate and updated information with us is required. It is your responsibility to ensure the email address on file is current or up to date at all times. We are not responsible for any claim, damages, fees, or otherwise as a result of accounts terminated or suspended due to inaccurate or unusable contact information. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You can update this information at any time in your client dashboard, email, or by telephone.<br><br>
				
				<b>Account Setup:</b><br>
				While we maintain the highest standards and try for near instant account activations this is not always possible. Certain account types such as dedicated servers, virtual private servers, and colocation services may often require a great deal of extra time to provision. At times additional fraud checks or information may be needed, and the client agrees to provide said information in a timely manner. We make no guarantees in regards to the speed in which an order is completed. Accounts will only enter the setup queue once we have received payment and screened the order for fraud. Accounts are then setup in the order they are paid, received, and screened. In certain cases such as dedicated or virtual private servers purchases and other high risk transactions, it may be necessary to provide government issued identification and a scan of the credit card used. If you fail to meet any requirements, the order may be canceled without notice.<br><br>
				
				<b>Account Transfers:</b><br>
				In certain cases where requested by the client we will transfer your data from the previous provider to our servers. This will be done with our best efforts, however, we do not guarantee the transfer process. This courtesy service is done on an as requested and as available on a case-by-case basis. Each provider may use different software, configurations, and/or other variables which complicate or in some cases prevent a smooth transfer. We will provide free transfers when possible as long as the new environment and control panel are the same as the old host/server. We will advise you if your free move is not possible and what the rate will be if you wish us to proceed at that point. We do not guarantee the transfers will be successful, complete, or done in a certain period of time.<br><br>
				
				<b>IP Ownership:</b><br>
				If we assign a Customer an Internet Protocol address for Customer's use, the right to use that Internet Protocol address shall belong only to us, and Customer shall have no right to use that Internet Protocol address except as permitted by us at our sole discretion in connection with the Services, during the term of this Agreement. We shall maintain and control ownership of all Internet Protocol numbers and addresses that may be assigned to Customer by us, and we reserve the right to change or remove any and all such Internet Protocol numbers and addresses, in its sole and absolute discretion. Our allocation of IP addresses is limited by RIPE policies (on UK servers) and ARIN policies (on USA servers).<br><br>
				
				<b>Service Plans:</b><br>
				Shared and semi-dedicated accounts may not resell hosting. All accounts that include endless disk space will start with no less than 50 GB of disk space quota. You may request more space via a simple button click in your cPanel when you have used 80% of your current allowance. Our system will automatically increase your quota and you can continue to request more every time you reach 80% usage. Clients may not use this space for anything other than active hosting files, i.e., files needed for their actual website. It is not to be used to store other data, backups, or archive files of any kind. Files must be publicly accessible and linked on your site.
               Resellers are responsible for supporting their own clients. We are happy to help you support your clients but all support requests must be made by the reseller on their client's behalf for security purposes. Resellers are responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account, clients accounts, and for the actions of their clients. Resellers and their clients are liable to and responsible for adhering to all the terms in this agreement. WebMobril.com reserves the right to reset the password if the password on file does not work if we are being direct to by law enforcement or to perform security audits. Clients must ensure the email, phone number, and passwords on file are current at all times.  WebMobril.com reserves the right to audit servers to ensure a secure and safe network. Dedicated servers are not backed up but we do offer several methods of added service for an additional fee to help clients setup a backup such as our enterprise backup service or adding an extra drive to the server. Please contact sales@ WebMobril.com or call us to discuss your options.<br><br>
			   
			  <b> WebMobril Rewards:</b><br>
			    WebMobril.com rewards program is an added service, extra and free. We reserve the right to end it at any time without compensation or replacement. We offer no guarantees, warranties, promises, or price locks. The details of the program can be altered or terminated at any time without prior notice. Reward points are eligible to be used towards the purchase of new services only and only for the initial payment of said new services. Subsequent payments towards the newly acquired services cannot be paid with reward points.<br><br>
			   
			   <b>Domain Registrations:</b><br>
			   You are also requesting us to register your site for you when selecting "new domain" in the order form of our site.  WebMobril.com will register such services for you on your behalf but it is your responsibility to ensure the correct name servers are set for your domain. All domain registrations are NON-REFUNDABLE. For free domain offers we will transfer domains only after the money back guarantee period has ended. You, as the registrant of the new domain, are required to ensure correct whois information is maintained at all times.<br><br>
			   
			   <b>Pricing:</b><br>
			   WebMobril.com reserves the right to change pricing terms on any accounts and services at anytime. While we have little control over third party licensing where prices can go up outside of our control, we will never increase an existing clients webhosting account plan price. However, addons such as domains, WHMCS, control panels, IP's, etc. are licensed from third parties and therefore are subject to change including any items currently provided free. New accounts for current customers are subject to the current fees at the time the new account is opened.<br><br>
				
				<b>Billing and Payments:</b><br>
				You agree to pay Infrenion.com in advance for the services to be rendered. Subsequent payments are due on the anniversary date of your plans term. You agree that until and unless you notify us using the proper cancellation form for all services received, those services are considered active, billable, and will be billed on a recurring basis. Client agrees to all annual and longer term recurring charges that are not canceled at least 45 days before the next renewal date. It is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. Infrenion.com reserves the right to bill your credit card or information on file. We are not responsible for any fees accessed on the client by their bank as a result of the client's account being invoiced. Infrenion.com provides a 5 day grace period from the time invoices are generated, however invoices not paid by due date are subject to a late fee of GBP 7.50 plus 10% (ten percent) interest of the past due amount for UK datacenter web hosting plans and $7.50 plus 10% (ten percent) interest of the past due amount for USA datacenter web hosting plans. Service will be interrupted on accounts that are 5 days past due. Service interrupted for nonpayment will remain disconnected until the account balance or contract term is paid in full.
Invoices that are paid more than once or any other over-payments can only be added as credit towards the account and can not be refunded. Any dispute to a credit card charge aka chargeback, wrongful or intentional, will result in a GBP 50 administrative fee in addition to the disputed charge before service can be restored. We may request payment in cashiers check or money order before restoring service. All billing disputes must be reported within 30 days of the time the dispute occurred. Infrenion.com may temporarily deny service or terminate this Agreement upon the failure of client to pay charges when due. Such termination or denial will not relieve client of responsibility for the payment of all accrued charges, plus reasonable interest and any collection fees.<br><br>

                 <b>Cancellation:</b><br>
				 All cancellations must be sent using the cancellation form in the support center/dashboard. Cancellations are effective the date the form is submitted unless otherwise request. While there are no cancellation fees, you must cancel prior to your next billing cycle. Payments made up to your cancellation date are not refundable unless you are canceling within the 60 money back guarantee period less any setup provisioning fees. Any due or past-due balance on your account must be paid in full to cancel. This does not include any added support or service fees you have contracted us to provide.
Until an account is officially canceled via cancellation form you are obligated to pay for your account even if you do not use it. It costs us on an ongoing basis to provision space, power, and bandwidth for services of our clients. We continue to provision those services for your use until you cancel with us therefore we can not know if you are not using the space after we have provisioned it. Because we have provisioned services and provided you with details you have the ability to use your account. An unused account still uses system resources that could be used for other customers.
If our internal collection efforts fail, Infrenion.com reserve the right to turn the account over to a 3rd-party (either collections agency or attorney) for further action at clients expense.
We reserve the right to report your unpaid balance to credit reporting agencies. Unpaid invoices may affect your credit rating. We place our highest priority on current clients as such cancellations are the lowest priority and may take up to 10 days to process. Cancellations will however be effective as per the effective date of the cancellation form as entered by the client. Our system will prevent future billings.<br><br>

<b>Refunds:</b><br>
Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. Refunds only apply to the money back guarantee. There are no refunds on domain name registrations, SSL certificates, cPanel or Plesk licenses, dedicated servers, colocation services, service addons, software licenses, administrative fees, support or install fees. Account renewals and recurring payments after the money back guarantee are non-refundable. We will not refund accounts that do not cancel before their next due date. Meaning, while canceling, your last payment made prior to canceling will not be refunded. Client may request a cancellation date that matches the service end date.<br><br>

<b>Staff and Personal Abuse:</b><br>
While we all try to get along sometimes that's a challenge. Please treat our staff and personnel as you would like to be treated yourself. While we are tolerant and understanding we too are human, please treat us as such. *looking at you angry guy*. You agree to refrain from abusive and profane language on our systems, interfaces, public, and private communications. Abuse of our staff in any medium or form will result in the suspension or termination of your services.<br><br>

<b>Attacks and Exploits:</b><br>
Any activity which affects the ability of other people or systems to use any services or other Internet services. This includes "denial of service" (DOS) attacks against another network host or individual user. Interference with or disruption of other network users, services or equipment is prohibited. It is the client's responsibility to ensure that their server is configured in a secure manner. A client may not, through action or inaction, allow others to use their network for illegal or inappropriate actions. Unauthorized entry and/or use of another company and/or individual's computer system will result in immediate account termination. We will not tolerate any subscriber attempting to access the accounts of others, or penetrate security measures of other systems.<br><br>
